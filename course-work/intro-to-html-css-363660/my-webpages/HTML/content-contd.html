<h1>Tables<hr></h1>

  <p>Here's an html snippet for how to make a table. The top rows of the table will be the table headers. You can't format these tables currently but you will be able to add borders and stuff with CSS.</p>

  <table>

    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Gender</th><th>City</th>
    <tr><td>Tanner</td><td>24</td><td>Male</td><td>Columbus</td>
    <tr><td>Aaron</td><td>30</td><td>Male</td><td>Upper Marlboro</td>
    <tr><td>Alpha</td><td>26</td><td>Male</td><td>Ashburn</td>
    <tr><td>Lauren</td><td>36</td><td>Female</td><td>Upper Marlboro</td>


  </table>


<h1><hr>iFrames</h1>

<p>An iFrame allows you to embed content from another webpage into your own webpage.Here's the last webpage we created.</p>

<iframe src="example-site-based-webpage.html"></iframe>

<p> You can use this to embed things like youtube videos. Here's a random song.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXj3EXYVR_o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The guy in the course couldn't embed this youtube video because it wasn't a "live" website. But this worked for me the first time. The missing piece for him was adding the website protocol, which is the https part, which we had when we copied this the first time. You have to remember to insert this if it's not provided in the embed link for other sites. You can also use a website called <u><em>jsbin.com</em></u> to look at content that may not be accessible from running the html code on your local machine.</p>
